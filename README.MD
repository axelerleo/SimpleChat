# SimpleChat

##A very simple chat, based on node.js, express.js, mongo.db and socket.io

I developed this application during the screencast https://learn.javascript.ru/screencast/nodejs

Although this course is already 5 years old, it has good explanations for basic things: authorization, logging, ejs templates, etc.

For some complication, I used the latest versions of all modules and applications (Expressjs 4, Bootstrap 4, socket.io 2.1.1, etc.). Therefore, I encountered several errors, because the syntax and logic of the modules changed slightly. Nevertheless, Google and Stackoverflow have helped me many times, and it worked out!

P.S.: sorry for bad English =)
